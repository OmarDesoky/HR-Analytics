# HR-Analytics
    Predictive analysis in identifying the employee most likely to get promoted. HRs usually do their jobs manually, analysing the data, recently they have discovered excel sheets to help them with very limited analysis without any sign of intelligence. Thatâ€™s why we are concerned with such an industry.
    This is one of the practice projects posted on Analytics Vidhya. The goal is to predict if a given employee should be promoted or not.
